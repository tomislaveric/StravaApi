# StravaSwiftSDK

This is an **!unofficial & WIP!** easy to use StravaSDK written in Swift for iOS and macOS. It uses async/await for the requests. It handles the OAuth authentication with another swift package i wrote ([OAuth](https://github.com/tomislaveric/oauth)). It will have all API endpoints implemented and all models.
